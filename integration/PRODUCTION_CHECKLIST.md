# Production deployment (example with PM2)
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start api/server.js --name "suiflow-api"
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### 3. **Deploy Frontend**
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
# Update environment variables in hosting dashboard
```

### 4. **Set Up Monitoring**

#### Application Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring for API
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Create dashboards for key metrics

#### Blockchain Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor contract events for anomalies
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed transactions
- [ ] Track admin fee accumulation
- [ ] Monitor gas usage patterns

### 5. **Documentation**
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Integration guide for merchants
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide created
- [ ] Contact information for support

## Post-Deployment

### âœ… Go-Live Checklist
- [ ] Test a small payment on mainnet
- [ ] Verify all monitoring is working
- [ ] Confirm admin functions work correctly
- [ ] Test wallet connections on production site
- [ ] Verify analytics and tracking

### âœ… Ongoing Operations
- [ ] Regular admin fee withdrawals scheduled
- [ ] Security updates planned and tested
- [ ] Backup admin keys stored securely
- [ ] Performance metrics reviewed weekly
- [ ] User feedback collection process established

## Emergency Procedures

### Contract Issues
1. **If smart contract has issues:**
   - Contract is immutable - cannot be changed
   - Deploy new contract version if needed
   - Update frontend to use new contract
   - Communicate changes to users

2. **If API is down:**
   - Users can still interact directly with contract
   - Fix API and redeploy
   - Monitor for any missed events

3. **If admin wallet is compromised:**
   - Immediately deploy new contract with different admin
   - Update all systems to use new contract
   - Notify users of the change

## Support Contacts
- **Smart Contract:** Contract deployed at [package_id]
- **API Issues:** Check logs at /var/log/suiflow/
- **Frontend Issues:** Check browser console and hosting logs
- **Wallet Issues:** Refer users to wallet provider support
